For each task, assign it to the most appropriate role from the available roles: 'developer'. Structure your response as ONLY a JSON array with objects containing 'role', 'task', and 'sequence' fields. The 'sequence' field is a positive integer that controls task execution order: tasks with the same sequence index can be executed in parallel, and different sequence indices define dependencies (all tasks with sequence N must complete before tasks with sequence N+1 begin). Example: [{\"role\": \"developer\", \"task\": \"Implement user authentication\", \"sequence\": 1}, {\"role\": \"developer\", \"task\": \"Set up database schema\", \"sequence\": 1}, {\"role\": \"developer\", \"task\": \"Integrate authentication with database\", \"sequence\": 2}]",
